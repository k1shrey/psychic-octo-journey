DIRECTIONS:
Method Soak the dal & rajma together for at least 3 hours. Now scrub it and wash it clean. Add 5 cups water and boil in a pressure cooker till dal splits and becomes thick.


Separately roughly cut the tomatoes and puree them. In a pan melt butter and saute ginger paste, garlic paste for 2 minutes. Now add the Kashmiri chili powder, stir and immediately add the tomato puree. Cook the tomatoes till they turn very thick & specs of butter ooze out. Add the tomatoes to the dal along with some water and salt.

Cook the dal for 30mins. In a separate pan heat oil and add chopped garlic. Brown the garlic and add it straight to the boiling dal. Add some more butter along with dried methi leave and cream. Remove and serve hot.
